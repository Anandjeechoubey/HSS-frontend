            The Department of Humanities and Social Sciences in IIT Roorkee
            (erstwhile University of Roorkee) was established in 1966 with a
            vision to integrate human values and social concerns with technical
            education. Over the years, it has developed into a lively
            department, encompassing teaching and research programs in the areas
            of English, Economics, Philosophy, Psychology, Sociology, Fine Arts
            and related inter & cross disciplinary subjects. Seventy two
            scholars have been awarded the Ph.D. degrees across different
            disciplines of the department. One of the notable achievements in
            recent years has been the expansion in research activities and
            exchanges of ideas, facilitated by the constant surge of
            discussions, consultations and publications in esteemed and high
            impact journals. Besides, there has been considerable progression of
            tangible and scholastic infrastructure which in process provides an
            impetus to its bright future.
